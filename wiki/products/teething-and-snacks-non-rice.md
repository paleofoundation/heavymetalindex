# Teething & Snacks (Non-Rice)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 15. No Category 1 source has been promoted from `raw/` to `wiki/sources/` for this row yet.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted A-tier sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: teething-food and snack datasets for non-rice products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Snack evidence is strong at the broad infant-snack level, but current sources do not split rice-based from non-rice snacks cleanly.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | FDA TDS baby food teething biscuits | 18 ug/kg hybrid mean | 18 ppb | [[sources/spungen2024-fda-tds-infant-lead-cadmium]] | Teething biscuit signal; rice status not specified. |
| [[metals/aluminum|Aluminum]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 5185 ug/kg | 5185 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snacks group; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 98 ug/kg | 98 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snacks group; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 58 to 62 ug/kg | 58 to 62 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snacks group; likely includes rice-containing products. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 24 ug/kg | 24 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snacks group; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 10 ug/kg | 10 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snacks group; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/nickel|Nickel]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 292 ug/kg | 292 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snacks group; rice status not isolated. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the clean-benchmark counterpart to [[products/teething-and-snacks-rice-based]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Risk characterization for this row is pending source ingest. <!-- UNCITED: Need teething-food and snack datasets that distinguish non-rice products and report measured concentrations for iAs, Cd, and Pb. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Potential variance drivers for non-rice teething foods and snacks should be documented only after sources distinguish grain type, snack format, processing, sourcing geography, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need snack or teething-food sources that separate non-rice from rice-based products and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]]. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/teething-and-snacks]], [[ingredients/non-rice-grains]], and snack-format targets as unresolved until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

Regulatory crosswalk pending. <!-- UNCITED: Need teething-food or snack-specific FDA, EU, Codex, or other agency sources before adding regulatory crosswalk claims for this row. -->

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

## Sources

- [[sources/spungen2024-fda-tds-infant-lead-cadmium]]
- [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]]
No source pages are currently cited for this row. No concentration, risk, variance, regulatory, or enforcement claim should be promoted from `<!-- UNCITED -->` status until a promoted `wiki/sources/` page exists.

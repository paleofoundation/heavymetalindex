# Root-Vegetable Purees

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 9. Four broad Category 1 sources have been promoted; puree-specific concentration distributions are still pending.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted A-tier sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: root-vegetable puree datasets for [[metals/cadmium|Cd]] and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Root-vegetable evidence includes FDA TDS named baby food sweet potato lead data and broader UK vegetable/potato categories.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | FDA TDS baby food sweet potatoes | 21 ug/kg hybrid mean | 21 ppb | [[sources/spungen2024-fda-tds-infant-lead-cadmium]] | Specific baby-food sweet-potato signal; not all root purees. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | FDA proposed lead action level for root vegetables | 20 ppb | 20 ppb | [[sources/price2023-baby-food-lead-biokinetic-models]] | Regulatory proposal/action-level context, not occurrence distribution. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK potatoes used in infant diet modeling | 21 ug/kg | 21 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Ingredient group, not finished puree. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK potatoes used in infant diet modeling | 0 to 1 ug/kg | 0 to 1 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Ingredient group, not finished puree. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK other vegetables used in infant diet modeling | 17 ug/kg | 17 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Mixed vegetable category; may include root vegetables. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK other vegetables used in infant diet modeling | 7 to 8 ug/kg | 7 to 8 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Mixed vegetable category; may include root vegetables. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/non-root-vegetable-purees]] for the cross-row architecture relationship covering [[metals/cadmium|Cd]] and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2022 narrative review summarized Parker et al. 2022 as finding arsenic in 100% of root-vegetable baby-food samples, lead in 88%, and cadmium in 67%; the same review reported that Parker et al. found non-cancer lead risk in grain, fruit, and root-vegetable products under that study's exposure assumptions. [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

A 2025 scoping review reported that Pb was detected in 97% of roots-and-tubers baby-food items and that roots/tubers had a median Pb concentration of 0.007 mg/kg among detected items. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2018 infant biomarker study found that, among weaning infants, vegetable intake was associated with the sum of urinary arsenic species (Spearman rho = 0.86, p = 0.01), but the study grouped vegetables as a dietary category rather than isolating root-vegetable purees. [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]]

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support root/tuber and vegetable concern at a broad baby-food category level, but they do not yet separate carrot, sweet potato, beet, puree processing, or brand formulation. [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]] [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]]

Potential variance drivers for root-vegetable purees should be documented only after sources distinguish root vegetable type, growing region, soil contribution, processing, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need puree or ingredient-level root vegetable sources that report metal concentrations and methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]]. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/root-vegetable-purees]], [[ingredients/carrot]], and [[ingredients/sweet-potato]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

FDA's 2023 proposed lead action levels, as summarized by Price et al. 2023, included 20 ppb for root vegetables and dry infant cereals, and FDA estimated a reduction in 90th-percentile dietary lead intake for fruits, root vegetables, and dry infant cereal combined if those action levels were implemented. [[sources/price2023-baby-food-lead-biokinetic-models]]

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

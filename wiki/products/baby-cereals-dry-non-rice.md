# Baby Cereals / Grain Products, Dry (Non-Rice)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 5. Broad cereal and infant-food sources have been promoted; non-rice cereal-specific p10/p90/p100 distributions are still pending.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with first distribution caveats; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: infant cereal datasets for non-rice dry grain products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Summary For Threshold Work

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current source set does not yet support a non-rice dry cereal p10/p90/p100 concentration spread. Parker 2022 provides a small grain baby-food distribution, but the authors report that two of three grain-product types were rice-based, so the table is more appropriate as a grain-category warning than a non-rice benchmark. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]]

| Evidence type | Analyte | Product or row fit | N | Statistic available | Values | Use for p10/p90/p100? | Caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grain baby-food distribution | [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | Grain baby foods, mostly rice-containing | 9 | min, mean, median, max, detection rate | min 10 ppb; mean 90.4 ppb; median 126 ppb; max 132 ppb; detected 9/9 | Not for non-rice threshold setting | Total arsenic, not iAs; row fit is weak because the grain group is mostly rice-containing. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]] |
| Grain baby-food distribution | [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | Grain baby foods, mostly rice-containing | 9 | min, mean, median, max, detection rate | min 12 ppb; mean 25.8 ppb; median 20 ppb; max 61 ppb; detected 9/9 | Not for non-rice threshold setting | Row fit is weak because the grain group is mostly rice-containing; no p10/p90. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]] |
| Grain baby-food distribution | [[metals/lead|Lead]] | Grain baby foods, mostly rice-containing | 9 | min, mean, median, max, detection rate | min 5 ppb; mean 9.7 ppb; median 5 ppb; max 20 ppb; detected 9/9 | Not for non-rice threshold setting | Row fit is weak because the grain group is mostly rice-containing; no p10/p90. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]] |

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Non-rice cereal evidence remains mixed because many infant cereal sources combine rice and non-rice cereals. Values below are included only with scope caveats.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | Processed baby-food cereal category in global scoping review | median 0.013 mg/kg | 13 ppb | [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] | Broad cereal category; may include rice and non-rice products. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | Parker 2022 grain baby foods | mean 25.8 ppb; median 20 ppb; max 61 ppb | mean 25.8 ppb; median 20 ppb; max 61 ppb | [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]] | Grain group, mostly rice-containing; weak row fit for non-rice. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | Parker 2022 grain baby foods | mean 9.7 ppb; median 5 ppb; max 20 ppb | mean 9.7 ppb; median 5 ppb; max 20 ppb | [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]] | Grain group, mostly rice-containing; weak row fit for non-rice. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | Mixed cereals marketed for weaning infants | up to 49 ug/kg | up to 49 ppb | [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]] | Secondary citation; mixed cereals include wheat, barley, oat, rye, sorghum, and/or millet. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | UK cereal-based infant foods/dishes | 10 ug/kg | 10 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Cereal-based infant foods/dishes; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | UK cereal-based infant foods/dishes | 5 to 6 ug/kg | 5 to 6 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Cereal-based infant foods/dishes; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK cereal-based infant foods/dishes | 3 ug/kg | 3 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Cereal-based infant foods/dishes; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK cereal-based infant foods/dishes | 0 to 1 ug/kg | 0 to 1 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Lower-bound/upper-bound non-detect treatment. |
| [[metals/nickel|Nickel]] | UK cereal-based infant foods/dishes | 124 to 127 ug/kg | 124 to 127 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Cereal-based infant foods/dishes; rice status not isolated. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the clean-benchmark counterpart to [[products/baby-cereals-dry-rice-based]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that cereals had the highest median Cd concentration among baby-food groups in the review at 0.013 mg/kg, and 17% of detected cereal items exceeded the Cd maximum level used by the authors. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

Gardener 2019 reported that cadmium values were higher in foods containing rice, quinoa, wheat, and oats, which makes non-rice cereal subtyping necessary before treating this row as a clean benchmark. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

Non-rice-specific risk remains unresolved because the promoted review's cereal grouping is broader than this row and may include products not cleanly separable by grain type. <!-- UNCITED: Need infant cereal or dry grain-product datasets that distinguish non-rice products and report measured concentrations for iAs, Cd, and Pb. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The promoted sources support cereal-level monitoring but do not yet distinguish oat, wheat, corn, quinoa, multigrain, fortification premix, or non-rice-only products. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Potential variance drivers for non-rice dry baby cereals should be documented only after sources distinguish grain type, fortification, sourcing geography, processing, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need comparative infant cereal sources that separate non-rice grain products from rice-based products and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]]. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/baby-cereals-dry]] and [[ingredients/non-rice-grains]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

FDA's 2023 proposed lead action levels, as summarized by Price et al. 2023, included 20 ppb for dry infant cereals. [[sources/price2023-baby-food-lead-biokinetic-models]]

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

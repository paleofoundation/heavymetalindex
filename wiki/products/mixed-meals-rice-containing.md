# Mixed Meals, Rice-Containing

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 13. FDA compliance samples provide a small rice-named mixture subset, while broader rice/rice-mix, savoury infant-food, and U.S. baby-food survey sources remain useful context.

## Federal / Regulatory Limits vs Field Findings

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

This is the fast comparison view for standards developers, regulators, retailers, brands, and legal teams. It shows the applicable federal or regulatory limit next to the current field-evidence state. It is not an HMTc pass/fail table; technical distributions remain in the evidence sections below.

| Metal | Federal / regulatory limit | Actual field finding | Decision read | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | [[regulations/fda2025-lead-processed-baby-foods]]: Federal FDA final action level: 10 ug/kg Pb. Scope: fruits; vegetables excluding single-ingredient root vegetables; mixtures including grain- and meat-based mixtures; yogurts; custards/puddings; single-ingredient meats for children under 2. Basis: as sold or ready-to-eat as applicable. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | Regulatory value loaded for mixtures; rice-containing status does not itself make this the dry-infant-cereal action level. | [[regulations/fda2025-lead-processed-baby-foods]]; [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]: EU European Commission maximum level: 20 ug/kg Pb. Scope: baby food and processed cereal-based food for infants and young children, except covered infant drinks and formula/medical foods. Basis: product as placed on market. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | EU maximum level loaded; field-finding comparison blocked until mixed-meal rows are extracted. | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]; [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |
| [[metals/cadmium]] (Cd) | [[regulations/eu-2023-915-cadmium]]: EU European Commission maximum level: 40 ug/kg Cd. Scope: baby food and processed cereal-based food for infants and young children. Basis: product as placed on market. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | EU maximum level loaded; field-finding comparison blocked until mixed-meal rows are extracted. | [[regulations/eu-2023-915-cadmium]]; [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |

## Evidence Governance

Public evidence label: **Modeled or limited evidence**.

This page is part of the Category 1 Evidence Fitness pilot. It summarizes source-backed occurrence evidence, partial distributions, and data gaps for this product row. Existing cited tables remain public page-level synthesis; value-level JSONL backfill is tracked separately in `data/evidence/category1_register.csv`.

This page does not publish or justify HMT&C certification limits. Public Index pages show what the cited sources say, what is still uncertain, and where readers can verify the evidence trail.

## HMTc Evidence Summary

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

This row's standards target is **contaminated-platform P10**. No listed metal currently has a publishable aggregate HMTc value at the 80-95% confidence gate. This generated summary does not publish final HMTc limits; it shows whether the evidence pool can support the row-standard percentile under the governing principles.

Clean benchmark rows use aggregate P90. Contaminated-platform rows use aggregate P10 by default, or P20 only when explicitly selected. Source-reported percentiles stay source context until admitted into the exact-row aggregate pool, and any final HMTc value must be no higher than the lowest applicable loaded regulatory cap.

| Metal | Standards target | Evidence pool | Confidence/readiness | Regulatory cap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | contaminated-platform P10 | 3 sources; 1 distribution source; 2 summary sources; N=9 | Below confidence gate: only one fit distribution source is loaded. | 10 ug/kg (fda2025_pb_baby_food_10) |
| [[metals/cadmium]] (Cd) | contaminated-platform P10 | 3 sources; 1 distribution source; 2 summary sources; N=9 | Below confidence gate: only one fit distribution source is loaded. | 40 ug/kg (eu2023_cd_babyfood_cereal_40) |
| [[metals/arsenic-total]] (tAs) | contaminated-platform P10 | 3 sources; 1 distribution source; 2 summary sources; N=9 | Below confidence gate: only one fit distribution source is loaded. | No loaded cap |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic]] (iAs) | contaminated-platform P10 | 1 source; 0 distribution sources; 1 summary source; N not loaded | Not estimable from summaries alone; needs sample-level values or the exact target percentile. | No loaded cap |
| [[metals/mercury-total]] (tHg) | contaminated-platform P10 | 1 source; 1 distribution source; 0 summary sources; N=3 | Below confidence gate: only one fit distribution source is loaded. | No loaded cap |
| [[metals/nickel]] (Ni) | contaminated-platform P10 | 1 source; 0 distribution sources; 1 summary source; N not loaded | Not estimable from summaries alone; needs sample-level values or the exact target percentile. | No loaded cap |

## Lead Benchmark Context

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->
<!-- lead-benchmark-context:start -->

HMI normalizes this row's lead benchmarks to ppb so regulatory ceilings, exposure screens, and occurrence values can be compared on one concentration scale. The values below do not all mean the same thing: FDA and EU entries are regulatory context, Prop 65 is a serving-based exposure screen, and source tables on this page remain occurrence evidence.

| Reference point | Lead ppb view | Basis | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current FDA | 10 ppb (FDA final guidance action level) | ready-to-eat processed baby-food mixture | Mixtures including grain-based mixtures; rice-containing status does not make the dry-infant-cereal lead action level apply |
| EU 2023/915 | 20 ppb | baby food as placed on market | EU maximum level. |
| Prop 65 MADL screen | 4.5 ppb | 21 CFR 101.12 strained/junior ready-to-serve infant food RACC of 110 g; toddler dinner RACC is 170 g | Derived from the 0.5 ug/day lead MADL using `500 ÷ grams/day`; not a product-specific food limit. |
| HMTc standards use | ppb-normalized context | FDA is 10 ppb and EU is 20 ppb; the Prop 65 equivalent is about 4.5 ppb at 110 g/day or 2.9 ppb at 170 g/day. | Use FDA 10 ppb as lead cap/context, but preserve rice as an ingredient-driver signal for arsenic and cadmium as well as lead occurrence. |

Rice-containing mixed meals need their own occurrence profile; do not substitute the dry cereal lead row.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with first distribution context; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: mixed-meal datasets for rice-containing products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Context

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current source set does not yet support a rice-containing mixed-meal HMTc contaminated-platform P10. Gardener 2019 includes jars/meals, pouches, and kids-meals categories and provides broad all-sample lead/cadmium percentiles, and the FSA other-savoury row is structured as EF-4 context only because rice-containing status is not isolated. Rice-containing mixed meals still need product-level extraction. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]] [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]]

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Rice-containing mixed meals are represented by rice/rice-mix baby-food evidence and broad savoury/cereal infant-food groupings.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## French TDS Category Rows

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Chekri 2019 reports French vegetable-based and meat/fish-based ready-to-eat infant meals. Several high-arsenic examples named in the paper contain rice, but Table 5 does not split rice-containing from non-rice meals, so these rows are relevant context rather than rice-specific p90 evidence. [[sources/chekri2019-french-infant-toddler-tds-trace-elements|Chekri 2019]]

| French TDS row | N | Basis | Al mean / max | tAs mean / max | Cd mean / max | Cr-total mean / max | Ni mean / max | Sn mean / max |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Vegetable-based ready-to-eat meals | 27 | as consumed | 575 / 2480 ppb | 3.33 / 17 ppb | 9.26 / 18 ppb | 50.4 / 92 ppb | 71.5 / 137 ppb | 59.5 / 143 ppb |
| Meat/fish-based ready-to-eat meals | 45 | as consumed | 597 / 2590 ppb | 27.5 / 411 ppb | 9.31 / 30 ppb | 68.9 / 155 ppb | 75.7 / 143 ppb | 49.3 / 83 ppb |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/mixed-meals-non-rice]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that rice/rice-mix baby foods had median Pb of 0.008 mg/kg and median As of 0.048 mg/kg among detected items, with 31% of detected rice/rice-mix items exceeding the Pb maximum level used by the authors and 30% exceeding the As maximum level. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

Gardener 2019 reported that cadmium values were higher in foods containing rice, quinoa, wheat, and oats and that lead values were elevated in foods containing rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

Rice-containing mixed-meal risk remains only partially supported because the promoted source's rice/rice-mix grouping does not specify complete mixed-meal formulation or rice share. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal datasets that distinguish rice-containing products and report measured concentrations for iAs, Cd, and Pb. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support rice as a priority ingredient platform, but they do not resolve rice ingredient form, meal composition, or arsenic speciation for mixed meals. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Potential variance drivers for rice-containing mixed meals should be documented only after sources distinguish rice ingredient form, formulation share, vegetable inclusion, sourcing geography, processing, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal baby-food sources that separate rice-containing from non-rice meals and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] and arsenic speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/mixed-meals]], [[ingredients/rice]], and [[ingredients/rice-flour]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

See the page-level crosswalk above and [[products/regulatory-crosswalk-field-findings]] for current regulatory context; row-specific enforcement events remain pending.

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

## Broad Product Context Awaiting AI Adjudication

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

These sources are visible as product context, but they are not direct locked-row evidence. Keep them out of HMTc standards-percentile calculations unless the AI adjudication layer writes an auditable extraction, row-fit, basis, analyte-species, and statistic-fit decision. Human review is reserved for low-confidence, high-impact, or policy-conflict exceptions.

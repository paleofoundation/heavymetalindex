# Mixed Meals, Rice-Containing

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 13. Broad rice/rice-mix, savoury infant-food, and U.S. baby-food survey sources have been promoted; rice-containing mixed-meal p10/p90/p100 datasets are still pending.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with first distribution context; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: mixed-meal datasets for rice-containing products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Summary For Threshold Work

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current source set does not yet support a rice-containing mixed-meal p10/p90/p100 concentration spread. Gardener 2019 includes jars/meals, pouches, and kids-meals categories and provides broad all-sample lead/cadmium percentiles, but rice-containing mixed meals still need product-level extraction. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

| Evidence type | Analyte | Product or row fit | N | Statistic available | Values | Use for p10/p90/p100? | Caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UK savoury category average | [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | Other savoury based infant foods/dishes, no meat | not extracted | category average/range | 7 to 9 ppb | Does not support p10/p90/p100 | Broad savoury mixed-food group; rice status not isolated. [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] |
| UK savoury category average | [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | Other savoury based infant foods/dishes, no meat | not extracted | category average | 10 ppb | Does not support p10/p90/p100 | Broad savoury mixed-food group; rice status not isolated. [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] |
| UK savoury category average | [[metals/lead|Lead]] | Other savoury based infant foods/dishes, no meat | not extracted | category average/range | 3 to 5 ppb | Does not support p10/p90/p100 | Broad savoury mixed-food group; rice status not isolated. [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] |
| All-sample baby-food/formula distribution | [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | Broad U.S. baby foods and formulas | 564 | p50, p75, p90, p95, p99, max | p50 2.76 ppb; p75 9.54 ppb; p90 20.75 ppb; p95 29.44 ppb; p99 42.50 ppb; max 103.90 ppb | Broad context only | All categories combined; mixed-meal and rice-status-specific values require source-table extraction. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]] |
| All-sample baby-food/formula distribution | [[metals/lead|Lead]] | Broad U.S. baby foods and formulas | 564 | p50, p75, p90, p95, p99, max | p50 0 ppb; p75 5.60 ppb; p90 10.80 ppb; p95 18.50 ppb; p99 62.75 ppb; max 183.60 ppb | Broad context only | All categories combined; mixed-meal and rice-status-specific values require source-table extraction.

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Rice-containing mixed meals are represented by rice/rice-mix baby-food evidence and broad savoury/cereal infant-food groupings.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | Rice/rice-mix baby foods in global scoping review | median 0.008 mg/kg | 8 ppb | [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] | Broad rice/rice-mix baby-food category. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Arsenic]] | Rice/rice-mix baby foods in global scoping review | median 0.048 mg/kg | 48 ppb | [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] | Review reports As; speciation may vary by included study. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | Rice products commonly eaten during weaning | up to 323 ug/kg | up to 323 ppb | [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]] | Secondary citation for baby rice/rice cereals/rice crackers. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | UK other savoury based infant foods/dishes, no meat | 7 to 9 ug/kg | 7 to 9 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad savoury mixed-food group; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK other savoury based infant foods/dishes, no meat | 10 ug/kg | 10 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad savoury mixed-food group. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK other savoury based infant foods/dishes, no meat | 3 to 5 ug/kg | 3 to 5 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad savoury mixed-food group. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/mixed-meals-non-rice]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that rice/rice-mix baby foods had median Pb of 0.008 mg/kg and median As of 0.048 mg/kg among detected items, with 31% of detected rice/rice-mix items exceeding the Pb maximum level used by the authors and 30% exceeding the As maximum level. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

Gardener 2019 reported that cadmium values were higher in foods containing rice, quinoa, wheat, and oats and that lead values were elevated in foods containing rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

Rice-containing mixed-meal risk remains only partially supported because the promoted source's rice/rice-mix grouping does not specify complete mixed-meal formulation or rice share. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal datasets that distinguish rice-containing products and report measured concentrations for iAs, Cd, and Pb. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support rice as a priority ingredient platform, but they do not resolve rice ingredient form, meal composition, or arsenic speciation for mixed meals. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Potential variance drivers for rice-containing mixed meals should be documented only after sources distinguish rice ingredient form, formulation share, vegetable inclusion, sourcing geography, processing, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal baby-food sources that separate rice-containing from non-rice meals and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] and arsenic speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/mixed-meals]], [[ingredients/rice]], and [[ingredients/rice-flour]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

Regulatory crosswalk pending. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal baby-food-specific FDA, EU, Codex, or other agency sources before adding regulatory crosswalk claims for this row. -->

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

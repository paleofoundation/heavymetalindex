# Teething & Snacks (Rice-Based)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 16. FDA compliance samples provide a very small rice-named snack subset and a broad grain-based snack context signal; broader rice/rice-mix baby-food, snack, and teething-biscuit sources remain important context.

## Federal / Regulatory Limits vs Field Findings

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

This is the fast comparison view for standards developers, regulators, retailers, brands, and legal teams. It shows the applicable federal or regulatory limit next to the current field-evidence state. It is not an HMTc pass/fail table; technical distributions remain in the evidence sections below.

| Metal | Federal / regulatory limit | Actual field finding | Decision read | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic]] (iAs) | No federal product-specific limit loaded in this crosswalk. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | Occurrence evidence only. Do not infer a federal exceedance or HMTc pass/fail result from this row. | [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |

## Evidence Governance

Public evidence label: **Modeled or limited evidence**.

This page is part of the Category 1 Evidence Fitness pilot. It summarizes source-backed occurrence evidence, partial distributions, and data gaps for this product row. Existing cited tables remain public page-level synthesis; value-level JSONL backfill is tracked separately in `data/evidence/category1_register.csv`.

This page does not publish or justify HMT&C certification limits. Public Index pages show what the cited sources say, what is still uncertain, and where readers can verify the evidence trail.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with first distribution context; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: teething-food and snack datasets for rice-based products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Context

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current source set does not yet support a rice-based snack p10/p90/p100 distribution. Gardener 2019 includes a snacks category and provides broad all-sample lead/cadmium percentiles, while the UK survey reports average sweet-and-savoury snack concentrations with notably higher arsenic, cadmium, lead, and nickel than many other infant-food categories. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]] [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]]

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Rice-based snack evidence combines broad snack data with rice-product arsenic evidence. Current sources do not always isolate teething/snack products from rice cereals and crackers.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | FDA FY2009-FY2024 rice-named grain-based snack subset | p50 96.3 ppb; p90/max 171 ppb | p50 96.3 ppb; p90/max 171 ppb | [[sources/fda2024-toxic-elements-baby-food-compliance-2009-2024]] | Only two rice-named snack rows; source reports As, not iAs. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | FDA broad grain-based snack context, rice status not isolated | p50 61 ppb; p90 224 ppb; p95 383 ppb; max 561 ppb | p50 61 ppb; p90 224 ppb; p95 383 ppb; max 561 ppb | [[sources/fda2024-toxic-elements-baby-food-compliance-2009-2024]] | Context only; cannot distinguish rice-based from non-rice snacks. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | FDA TDS baby food teething biscuits | 18 ug/kg hybrid mean | 18 ppb | [[sources/spungen2024-fda-tds-infant-lead-cadmium]] | Teething biscuit signal; rice status not specified. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | Rice products commonly eaten during weaning | up to 323 ug/kg | up to 323 ppb | [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]] | Secondary citation for baby rice/rice cereals/rice crackers. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 98 ug/kg | 98 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snack category; likely relevant to rice snacks but not isolated. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 58 to 62 ug/kg | 58 to 62 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snack category; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 24 ug/kg | 24 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snack category; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 10 ug/kg | 10 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snack category; rice status not isolated. |
| [[metals/nickel|Nickel]] | UK sweet and savoury snacks | 292 ug/kg | 292 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Broad snack category; rice status not isolated. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/teething-and-snacks-non-rice]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that rice/rice-mix baby foods had median Pb of 0.008 mg/kg and median As of 0.048 mg/kg among detected items, with 31% of detected rice/rice-mix items exceeding the Pb maximum level used by the authors and 30% exceeding the As maximum level. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2022 narrative review identifies rice-based weaning products as an arsenic concern and cites evidence of increased infant urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites after weaning with rice products. [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Gardener 2019 reported that cadmium values were higher in foods containing rice, quinoa, wheat, and oats and that lead values were elevated in foods containing rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support rice/rice-mix concern, but they do not resolve teething-food format, puff processing, rice ingredient form, or serving pattern. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Potential variance drivers for rice-based teething foods and snacks should be documented only after sources distinguish rice ingredient form, snack format, processing, sourcing geography, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need snack or teething-food sources that separate rice-based from non-rice products and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] and arsenic speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/teething-and-snacks]], [[ingredients/rice]], [[ingredients/rice-flour]], and [[ingredients/rice-puffs]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

See the page-level crosswalk above and [[products/regulatory-crosswalk-field-findings]] for current regulatory context; row-specific enforcement events remain pending.

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

# Fruit Juices, Apple-Containing

This page is HMTc Category 5 row 2 from the locked beverage architecture. It exists as a wiki node so evidence, regulatory context, ingredient routing, and future field findings have a stable place to land.

## Decision Snapshot

| Field | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Row state | Locked row node; structured occurrence extraction started |
| Category hub | [[products/category-5-beverages]] |
| Crosswalk hub | [[products/regulatory-crosswalk-field-findings]] |
| HMTc use | Routing and evidence-gap tracking only; not a certification threshold |

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

FDA TDS food 99 routes to this row as bottled apple juice. These source summaries are useful occurrence context, but the sample size is three and no aggregate HMTc p90 is published from this row alone. [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Source-use caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | TDS 99 apple juice, bottled | N=3; p50 1.5 ppb; p90 2.46 ppb; p95 2.58 ppb; max 2.7 ppb | Small-N single-food route; draft FDA lead value remains draft-only context. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | TDS 99 apple juice, bottled | N=3; p50 2.4 ppb; p90 4 ppb; p95 4.2 ppb; max 4.4 ppb | Total arsenic only; do not use as inorganic arsenic evidence. |

## Federal / Regulatory Limits vs Field Findings

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

This is the fast comparison view for standards developers, regulators, retailers, brands, and legal teams. It shows the applicable federal or regulatory limit next to the current field-evidence state. It is not an HMTc pass/fail table; technical distributions remain in the evidence sections below.

| Metal | Federal / regulatory limit | Actual field finding | Decision read | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic]] (iAs) | [[regulations/fda2023-inorganic-arsenic-apple-juice]]: Federal FDA final action level: 10 ug/kg iAs. Scope: apple juice. Basis: juice. | FDA TDS reports total arsenic for apple juice, not iAs; FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 apple juice rows provide N=3 bottled apple-juice results: Pb median 1.5 ppb, P95 2.58 ppb, max 2.7 ppb; total arsenic max 4.4 ppb, with no apple-juice iAs speciation row. | Limit is visible, but exceedance comparison is blocked until product-row values are extracted and basis/species match. | [[regulations/fda2023-inorganic-arsenic-apple-juice]]; [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]] |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic]] (iAs) | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]: EU European Commission maximum level: 20 ug/kg iAs. Scope: fruit juices, concentrated fruit juices as reconstituted, and fruit nectars. Basis: wet weight or reconstituted juice. | FDA TDS reports total arsenic for apple juice, not iAs; no apple-juice inorganic-arsenic row is present. | EU maximum level loaded; direct comparison remains blocked until beverage occurrence sources are promoted with inorganic arsenic species. | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]; [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]] |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | [[regulations/fda2022-draft-lead-juice]]: Federal FDA draft level, not final: 10 ug/kg Pb. Scope: single-strength apple juice. Basis: single-strength ready-to-drink juice. | FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 apple juice rows provide N=3 bottled apple-juice results: Pb median 1.5 ppb, P95 2.58 ppb, max 2.7 ppb; total arsenic max 4.4 ppb, with no apple-juice iAs speciation row. | Draft context only. Do not present this value as a final federal limit or an HMTc threshold. | [[regulations/fda2022-draft-lead-juice]]; [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]] |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]: EU European Commission maximum level: 30 ug/kg Pb. Scope: fruit juices, fruit juices from concentrate, concentrated fruit juices, and fruit nectars other than exclusively from berries and other small fruits. Basis: wet weight or reconstituted juice. | FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 apple juice rows provide N=3 bottled apple-juice results: Pb median 1.5 ppb, P95 2.58 ppb, max 2.7 ppb; total arsenic max 4.4 ppb, with no apple-juice iAs speciation row. | EU maximum level loaded; the small-N apple-juice TDS row is below 30 ug/kg, but this is occurrence context and not an HMTc category distribution. | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]; [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]] |

## Evidence Handling

Finished-product findings belong on this product page. Ingredient-only findings belong on ingredient pages before they are used for product inference.

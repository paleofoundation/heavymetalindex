# Infant Formula, Powder (Soy-Based)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 2. Three infant-formula or powdered-milk sources have been promoted from `raw/` to `wiki/sources/`; soy-powder-specific evidence is still pending.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted A-tier sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: soy-based powdered infant formula datasets that distinguish protein source while measuring [[metals/aluminum|Al]], [[metals/nickel|Ni]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and the full testing panel.
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Soy-specific formula evidence is thinner than broad formula evidence, but the UK survey provides a direct dry soy-formula row and Jackson 2012 provides an ingredient-specific soy toddler-formula arsenic contrast.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/aluminum|Aluminum]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 2550 ug/kg | 2550 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Direct soy dry-formula category average; UK market. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 7 ug/kg | 7 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Total arsenic; UK category average. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 4.6 ug/kg | 4.6 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | iAs estimated/reported per survey method. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 11 ug/kg | 11 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Direct soy dry-formula category average. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 0 to 5 ug/kg | 0 to 5 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Lower-bound/upper-bound non-detect treatment. |
| [[metals/nickel|Nickel]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 200 ug/kg | 200 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Direct soy dry-formula category average. |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|Inorganic arsenic]] | Reconstituted organic brown-rice-syrup soy toddler formula | 1.5 to 2.5 times the 10 ug/L drinking-water standard | approximately 15 to 25 ppb in liquid formula | [[sources/jackson2012-arsenic-organic-foods-brown-rice-syrup]] | Toddler formula with organic brown rice syrup, not standard infant soy powder. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/infant-formula-powder-non-soy]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/aluminum|Al]], [[metals/nickel|Ni]], and [[metals/cadmium|Cd]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 global scoping review of baby foods and infant formulas reported heavy-metal detections in 63% of evaluated infant-formula determinations, with [[metals/lead|Pb]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], [[metals/arsenic-total|As]], and [[metals/mercury-total|Hg]] each detected in formula items; in the review's primary-protein-source subgrouping, Pb was detected in 84% of soy-based formula items and Cd in 91% of soy-based formula items. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2018 infant biomarker study cited prior work reporting total arsenic in formula powder up to 12.6 ug/kg, but the study does not separate soy-based from non-soy powdered formula. [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]]

A 2024 analytical study of European baby foods included powdered milk and reported that cadmium and lead were below the study LOD in all samples, while mercury was detectable in all samples and one powdered-milk sample had the highest estimated nickel intake in the study at 9.43 ug/kg body weight per day. [[sources/meli2024-chemical-characterization-baby-food-italy]]

Soy-powder-specific risk characterization remains pending. <!-- UNCITED: Need soy-based powdered infant formula sources that measure Al, Ni, Cd, Pb, tAs/iAs, tHg/MeHg, Cr-VI, and Sn while distinguishing soy-based powder from non-soy powder and ready-to-feed liquid formula. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The promoted formula scoping review separates soy-based formulas from cow-based and nonspecified formulas, but it does not resolve powder-versus-ready-to-feed differences for this row. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

The promoted powdered-milk analytical study resolves powder format but does not resolve soy versus non-soy formula. [[sources/meli2024-chemical-characterization-baby-food-italy]]

Potential variance drivers for soy-based powdered formula should be documented only after sources distinguish soy inputs, mineral premix, processing equipment, packaging, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need comparative infant-formula sources that separate soy-based powder from non-soy powder and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]]. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/infant-formula-powder]], [[ingredients/soy-based-infant-formula]], and [[ingredients/soy-protein-isolate]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

Regulatory crosswalk pending. <!-- UNCITED: Need formula-specific FDA, EU, Codex, or other agency sources before adding regulatory crosswalk claims for this row. -->

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

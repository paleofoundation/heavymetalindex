# Baby Cereals / Grain Products, Dry (Rice-Based)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 6. Quantitative evidence now includes rice/rice-mix review evidence, a small grain baby-food distribution, a large U.S. baby-food lead/cadmium survey, and regulatory action-level context; dry rice-cereal-specific p10/p90/p100 distributions remain incomplete.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with first distribution entries; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values and distribution tables populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the tables.
- Next ingest target: infant cereal datasets for rice-based dry grain products that report individual-product distributions for [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Summary For Threshold Work

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Parker 2022 provides a small grain baby-food concentration distribution with N=9, but the grain group is not fully equivalent to dry rice cereal; the authors report that two of three grain-product types were rice-based and that arsenic was not speciated. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]]

Gardener 2019 provides a much larger lead/cadmium baby-food survey and reports cereal category counts, but the primary published distribution table is for all 564 baby-food/formula samples rather than rice-cereal-only values. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Rice-based cereal has the strongest arsenic signal in Category 1. Values include rice/rice-mix baby-food evidence, grain baby-food distributions, and regulatory action levels for infant rice cereal.

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/baby-cereals-dry-non-rice]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that rice/rice-mix baby foods had median Pb of 0.008 mg/kg and median As of 0.048 mg/kg among detected items; 31% of detected rice/rice-mix items exceeded the Pb maximum level used by the authors and 30% exceeded the As maximum level. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2022 narrative review describes rice as a key infant-food concern and cites evidence that infant urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites increased 4.5-fold after weaning with rice products. [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

A 2018 infant biomarker study found that, among weaning infants, rice cereal intake was associated with the sum of urinary arsenic species (Spearman rho = 0.90, p = 0.03). [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]]

Parker 2022 found the highest total arsenic values in its grain baby-food group, with N=9, 100% detection, mean 90.4 ppb, median 126 ppb, and max 132 ppb. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]]

Gardener 2019 reported that cadmium values were higher in foods containing rice, quinoa, wheat, and oats and that lead values were elevated in foods containing rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support rice/rice-mix concern, but they do not yet distinguish rice flour, rice cereal, rice puffs, rice origin, or arsenic speciation for this exact dry-cereal row. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Potential variance drivers for rice-based dry baby cereals should be documented only after sources distinguish rice ingredient form, sourcing geography, processing, fortification, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need comparative infant cereal sources that separate rice-based products from non-rice products and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] and arsenic speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/baby-cereals-dry]], [[ingredients/rice-flour]], and [[ingredients/rice-cereal]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

FDA's 2023 proposed lead action levels, as summarized by Price et al. 2023, included 20 ppb for dry infant cereals. [[sources/price2023-baby-food-lead-biokinetic-models]]

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

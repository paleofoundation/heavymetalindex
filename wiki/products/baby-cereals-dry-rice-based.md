# Baby Cereals / Grain Products, Dry (Rice-Based)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 6. Five Category 1 sources have been promoted; FSA/Fera now adds government monitoring evidence for baby rice and rice-containing dry grain products, while detailed structured distributions remain pending.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: structural scaffold, not synthesis.
- Source coverage: 5 A-tier / 0 B-tier sources.
- Next ingest target: infant cereal datasets for rice-based dry grain products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/baby-cereals-dry-non-rice]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that rice/rice-mix baby foods had median Pb of 0.008 mg/kg and median As of 0.048 mg/kg among detected items; 31% of detected rice/rice-mix items exceeded the Pb maximum level used by the authors and 30% exceeded the As maximum level. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2022 narrative review describes rice as a key infant-food concern and cites evidence that infant urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites increased 4.5-fold after weaning with rice products. [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

A 2018 infant biomarker study found that, among weaning infants, rice cereal intake was associated with the sum of urinary arsenic species (Spearman rho = 0.90, p = 0.03). [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]]

The FSA/Fera 2014 UK survey measured finished baby rice, smooth baby rice, rice cakes, rice-containing cereals, and rice-containing snacks as sold, with total arsenic and triggered inorganic arsenic follow-up. Rice-labeled dry cereal products route here rather than to the non-rice cereal row. [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]]

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support rice/rice-mix concern, but they do not yet distinguish rice flour, rice cereal, rice puffs, rice origin, or arsenic speciation for this exact dry-cereal row. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

The FSA/Fera source supplies product descriptions and an inorganic arsenic trigger rule, but app scoring still needs structured extraction before separating rice cereal, baby rice, rice cakes, and mixed rice-grain products. [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]]

Potential variance drivers for rice-based dry baby cereals should be documented only after sources distinguish rice ingredient form, sourcing geography, processing, fortification, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need comparative infant cereal sources that separate rice-based products from non-rice products and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] and arsenic speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/baby-cereals-dry]], [[ingredients/rice-flour]], and [[ingredients/rice-cereal]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Regulatory Crosswalk vs Field Findings

This layer separates external regulatory values from observed field findings and from HMTc standards-development use. Regulatory values are context or caps; they are not automatically HMTc limits.

| Metal | Regulatory value | Regulatory status/scope | Current field finding | HMTc use |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Pb | 20 ug/kg [[regulations/fda2025-lead-processed-baby-foods]] | final guidance action level; dry infant cereals for children under 2 | Promoted source coverage exists; structured row extraction pending. | Use as external regulatory cap/context, not HMTc value. |
| iAs | 100 ug/kg [[regulations/fda2020-inorganic-arsenic-infant-rice-cereal]] | final guidance action level; all types of infant rice cereals | Promoted source coverage exists; structured row extraction pending. | Use as external regulatory cap/context, not HMTc value. |

See [[products/regulatory-crosswalk-field-findings]] for the full cross-category comparison layer and review rules.

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

FDA's 2023 proposed lead action levels, as summarized by Price et al. 2023, included 20 ppb for dry infant cereals. [[sources/price2023-baby-food-lead-biokinetic-models]]

No row-specific regulatory enforcement event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

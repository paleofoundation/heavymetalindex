# Baby Cereals / Grain Products, Dry (Rice-Based)

This page is a structural scaffold for Category 1 row 6. Quantitative evidence now includes FDA rice-cereal compliance samples, rice/rice-mix review evidence, a small grain baby-food distribution, a large U.S. baby-food lead/cadmium survey, and regulatory action-level context.

## Standards Evidence Matrix

<!-- audience: regulator, retailer, brand, legal, app -->

This is the product evidence matrix for standards development. It does not treat a single study statistic as a finished standard. The page shows the metal, extracted N, loaded source statistics, regulatory reference values, resources, and evidence gaps so cited calculations can be run from approved rows.

<p class="hmi-standards-readiness-note"><strong>Calculation boundary:</strong> public product pages show inputs and completeness, not final standards math. A single distribution-capable source or summary/range-only evidence remains an input until the fit-source pool, basis/species decisions, censoring rules, and calculation trace are documented.</p>

## Standards Decision Matrix

<!-- audience: regulator, retailer, brand, legal, app -->

This matrix translates the product evidence into the decisions the page needs to support. It keeps HMTc standards calculations, regulatory references, operational QC, and legal defensibility separate so a visible limit is not mistaken for a finished HMTc standard.

## Evidence Governance

Public evidence label: **Modeled or limited evidence**.

This page is part of the Category 1 Evidence Fitness pilot. It summarizes source-backed occurrence evidence, partial distributions, and data gaps for this product row. Existing cited tables remain public page-level synthesis; value-level JSONL backfill is tracked separately in `data/evidence/category1_register.csv`.

This page does not publish or justify certification limits. Public Index pages show what the cited sources say, what is still uncertain, and where readers can verify the evidence trail.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with first distribution entries; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values and distribution tables populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the tables.
- Next ingest target: infant cereal datasets for rice-based dry grain products that report individual-product distributions for [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Context

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Parker 2022 provides a small grain baby-food concentration distribution with N=9, but the grain group is not fully equivalent to dry rice cereal; the authors report that two of three grain-product types were rice-based and that arsenic was not speciated. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]]

Gardener 2019 provides a much larger lead/cadmium baby-food survey and reports cereal category counts, but the primary published distribution table is for all 564 baby-food/formula samples rather than rice-cereal-only values. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Rice-based cereal has the strongest arsenic signal in Category 1. Values include rice/rice-mix baby-food evidence, grain baby-food distributions, and regulatory action levels for infant rice cereal.

## French TDS Category Rows

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Chekri 2019 reports a French cereal-based infant-food category with N=17. The table does not split rice-based cereals from non-rice cereals, so the values below are relevant context but cannot be treated as rice-specific upper-percentile evidence. [[sources/chekri2019-french-infant-toddler-tds-trace-elements|Chekri 2019]]

| French TDS row | N | Basis | Al mean / max | tAs mean / max | Cd mean / max | Cr-total mean / max | Ni mean / max | Sn mean / max |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cereal-based infant foods | 17 | as consumed | 630 / 3810 ppb | 3.13 / 8 ppb | 2.79 / 17 ppb | 23 / 125 ppb | 43 / 234 ppb | 49.2 / 83 ppb |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/baby-cereals-dry-non-rice]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 scoping review reported that rice/rice-mix baby foods had median Pb of 0.008 mg/kg and median As of 0.048 mg/kg among detected items; 31% of detected rice/rice-mix items exceeded the Pb maximum level used by the authors and 30% exceeded the As maximum level. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2022 narrative review describes rice as a key infant-food concern and cites evidence that infant urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites increased 4.5-fold after weaning with rice products. [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

A 2018 infant biomarker study found that, among weaning infants, rice cereal intake was associated with the sum of urinary arsenic species (Spearman rho = 0.90, p = 0.03). [[sources/signes-pastor2018-infants-dietary-arsenic-solid-food]]

Parker 2022 found the highest total arsenic values in its grain baby-food group, with N=9, 100% detection, mean 90.4 ppb, median 126 ppb, and max 132 ppb. [[sources/parker2022-baby-food-arsenic-cadmium-lead-mercury-risk]]

Gardener 2019 reported that cadmium values were higher in foods containing rice, quinoa, wheat, and oats and that lead values were elevated in foods containing rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. [[sources/gardener2019-lead-cadmium-infant-formula-baby-food]]

Meli 2024 reported a cereal-cream/grain-product mercury exposure signal in a small Italian/European-market baby-food set, but the study did not speciate methylmercury and should be used only as a row-level monitoring flag. [[sources/meli2024-chemical-characterization-baby-food-italy]]

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current promoted sources support rice/rice-mix concern, but they do not yet distinguish rice flour, rice cereal, rice puffs, rice origin, or arsenic speciation for this exact dry-cereal row. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] [[sources/bair2022-heavy-metals-infant-toddler-foods]]

Potential variance drivers for rice-based dry baby cereals should be documented only after sources distinguish rice ingredient form, sourcing geography, processing, fortification, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need comparative infant cereal sources that separate rice-based products from non-rice products and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] and arsenic speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/baby-cereals-dry]], [[ingredients/rice-flour]], and [[ingredients/rice-cereal]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

FDA's 2023 proposed lead action levels, as summarized by Price et al. 2023, included 20 ppb for dry infant cereals. [[sources/price2023-baby-food-lead-biokinetic-models]]

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

# Infant Formula, RTF Liquid (Soy-Based)

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 4. One broad infant-formula source has been promoted; ready-to-feed-specific and Al/Ni-specific evidence is still pending.

## Evidence Governance

Public evidence label: **Modeled or limited evidence**.

This page is part of the Category 1 Evidence Fitness pilot. It summarizes source-backed occurrence evidence, partial distributions, and data gaps for this product row. Existing cited tables remain public page-level synthesis; value-level JSONL backfill is tracked separately in `data/evidence/category1_register.csv`.

This page does not publish or justify HMT&C certification limits. HMT&C may use approved Index evidence downstream under its own standards methodology, but HMT&C thresholds are not evidence for public Index claims.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted A-tier sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: formula-specific [[metals/aluminum|Al]], [[metals/nickel|Ni]], and [[metals/cadmium|Cd]] data for soy-based ready-to-feed liquid infant formula.
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

No promoted source currently gives a ready-to-feed soy-formula concentration table. The closest direct evidence is ready-to-feed formula without a soy split and dry soy formula as sold.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK ready-to-feed first/hungrier milk | 0 to 0.4 ug/L | 0 to 0.4 ppb in liquid formula | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Ready-to-feed formula, but not soy-specific. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK ready-to-feed first/hungrier milk | 0 to 0.2 ug/L | 0 to 0.2 ppb in liquid formula | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Ready-to-feed formula, but not soy-specific. |
| [[metals/aluminum|Aluminum]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 2550 ug/kg | 2550 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Soy-specific, but dry powder rather than ready-to-feed liquid. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 11 ug/kg | 11 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Soy-specific, but dry powder rather than ready-to-feed liquid. |
| [[metals/nickel|Nickel]] | UK dry soy-based formula, as sold | 200 ug/kg | 200 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Soy-specific, but dry powder rather than ready-to-feed liquid. |

## Row Relationship

This row is the contamination-platform counterpart to [[products/infant-formula-rtf-liquid-non-soy]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/aluminum|Al]], [[metals/nickel|Ni]], and [[metals/cadmium|Cd]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 global scoping review of baby foods and infant formulas reported heavy-metal detections in 63% of evaluated infant-formula determinations; in its primary-protein-source subgrouping, Pb was detected in 84% of soy-based formula items and Cd in 91% of soy-based formula items. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

Ready-to-feed-specific risk characterization for [[metals/aluminum|Al]] and [[metals/nickel|Ni]] remains pending. <!-- UNCITED: Need soy-based ready-to-feed liquid infant formula sources that measure Al and Ni and distinguish ready-to-feed liquid from powder. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The promoted formula scoping review separates soy-based formulas from cow-based and nonspecified formulas, but it does not resolve powder-versus-ready-to-feed differences for this row. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

Potential variance drivers for soy-based ready-to-feed formula should be documented only after sources distinguish soy inputs, water inputs, processing equipment, packaging, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need comparative infant-formula sources that separate soy-based ready-to-feed liquid formula from non-soy ready-to-feed liquid formula and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]]. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/infant-formula-rtf-liquid]], [[ingredients/soy-based-infant-formula]], and [[ingredients/soy-protein-isolate]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

Regulatory crosswalk pending. <!-- UNCITED: Need formula-specific FDA, EU, Codex, or other agency sources before adding regulatory crosswalk claims for this row. -->

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

# Fish-Containing Baby Foods

This page is a structural scaffold for Category 1 row 11. Three fish, mercury, or baby-food sources have been promoted; finished-product fish baby-food datasets are still pending.

## Standards Evidence Matrix

<!-- audience: regulator, retailer, brand, legal, app -->

This is the product evidence matrix for standards development. It does not treat a single study statistic as a finished standard. The page shows the metal, extracted N, grouped source statistics, regulatory reference values, source pages, and evidence gaps so cited calculations can be run from approved rows.

<p class="hmi-standards-readiness-note"><strong>Calculation boundary:</strong> public product pages show inputs and completeness, not final standards math. A single distribution-capable source or summary/range-only evidence remains an input until the fit-source pool, basis/species decisions, censoring rules, and calculation trace are documented.</p>

## Standards Decision Matrix

<!-- audience: regulator, retailer, brand, legal, app -->

This matrix translates the product evidence into the decisions the page needs to support. It keeps HMTc standards calculations, regulatory references, operational QC, and legal defensibility separate so a visible limit is not mistaken for a finished HMTc standard.

## Evidence Governance

Public evidence label: **Modeled or limited evidence**.

This page is part of the Category 1 Evidence Fitness pilot. It summarizes source-backed occurrence evidence, partial distributions, and data gaps for this product row. Existing cited tables remain public page-level synthesis; value-level JSONL backfill is tracked separately in `data/evidence/category1_register.csv`.

This page does not publish or justify certification limits. Public Index pages show what the cited sources say, what is still uncertain, and where readers can verify the evidence trail.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted A-tier sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: fish-containing baby-food or fish ingredient datasets that report both [[metals/mercury-total|tHg]] and [[metals/mercury-methyl|MeHg]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Measured Values And Concentration Evidence

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Fish-containing baby foods have arsenic and mercury signals, but many sources group fish with mixed fish/meat foods or total diet stages.

| Analyte | Evidence scope | Reported value | Approximate ppb equivalent | Source | Row-fit caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Arsenic]] | Fish/fish-mix baby foods in global scoping review | median 0.165 mg/kg | 165 ppb | [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] | Broad fish/fish-mix category. |
| [[metals/mercury-total|Mercury]] | Fish/fish-mix baby foods in global scoping review | median 0.016 mg/kg | 16 ppb | [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]] | Mercury species not guaranteed across included studies. |
| [[metals/mercury-total|Total mercury]] | Baby food stage 3 duplicate-diet stage | median 0.445 ng/g wet weight | 0.445 ppb wet weight | [[sources/tatsuta2024-methylmercury-intake-children-duplicate-diet]] | Total diet stage, not isolated commercial fish baby food. |
| [[metals/methylmercury|Methylmercury]] | Baby food stage 3 duplicate-diet stage | median intake 22.5 ng/kg bw/day | not a concentration ppb value | [[sources/tatsuta2024-methylmercury-intake-children-duplicate-diet]] | Intake estimate; fish is a likely driver. |
| [[metals/arsenic-total|Total arsenic]] | UK meat and fish based infant foods/dishes | 15 ug/kg | 15 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Combines meat and fish. |
| [[metals/cadmium|Cadmium]] | UK meat and fish based infant foods/dishes | 9 ug/kg | 9 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Combines meat and fish. |
| [[metals/lead|Lead]] | UK meat and fish based infant foods/dishes | 4 to 5 ug/kg | 4 to 5 ppb | [[sources/fsa2016-infant-food-formula-metals-survey]] | Combines meat and fish. |

## French TDS Category Rows

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Chekri 2019 reports a French meat/fish-based ready-to-eat infant-meal category with N=45. The row is relevant to fish-containing baby foods, but it also includes meat meals and does not isolate fish products. [[sources/chekri2019-french-infant-toddler-tds-trace-elements|Chekri 2019]]

| French TDS row | N | Basis | Al mean / max | tAs mean / max | Cd mean / max | Cr-total mean / max | Ni mean / max | Sn mean / max |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Meat/fish-based ready-to-eat meals | 45 | as consumed | 597 / 2590 ppb | 27.5 / 411 ppb | 9.31 / 30 ppb | 68.9 / 155 ppb | 75.7 / 143 ppb | 49.3 / 83 ppb |

## Row Relationship

This row uses an aggregate non-fish Category 1 reference relationship in the row architecture for [[metals/mercury-methyl|MeHg]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

A 2025 global scoping review found that fish/fish-mix baby foods had the highest median arsenic concentration among baby-food groups in the review at 0.165 mg/kg and the highest median mercury concentration at 0.016 mg/kg; Hg was detected in 100% of fish/fish-mix items in that review's baby-food grouping. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

A 2024 analytical study of European baby foods included fish homogenized foods and reported that a salmon homogenized food had the highest estimated daily intake for total arsenic in the study at 0.143 ug/kg body weight per day; the same study reported total mercury but did not speciate methylmercury. [[sources/meli2024-chemical-characterization-baby-food-italy]]

A 2024 duplicate-diet study of Japanese children aged 0-5 measured both total mercury and methylmercury; among diet samples with total mercury at or above 1 ng/g, methylmercury had a median concentration of 1.70 ng/g and accounted for 90.0% of total mercury. [[sources/tatsuta2024-methylmercury-intake-children-duplicate-diet]]

Finished-product MeHg characterization remains incomplete because the promoted methylmercury source is diet-stage-based rather than limited to commercial fish-containing baby foods. <!-- UNCITED: Need fish-containing baby-food datasets, or clearly labeled fish ingredient datasets, that distinguish [[metals/mercury-methyl|MeHg]] from total mercury. -->

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The promoted scoping review supports fish/fish-mix products as a priority group for Hg and As, but it does not resolve fish species, formulation share, or mercury speciation. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

The promoted duplicate-diet study links higher methylmercury intake during later baby-food stages to fish-consumption patterns, but it does not isolate the commercial product share of each diet sample. [[sources/tatsuta2024-methylmercury-intake-children-duplicate-diet]]

Potential variance drivers for fish-containing baby foods should be documented only after sources distinguish fish species, serving form, formulation share, sourcing, processing, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need fish baby-food or fish ingredient sources that report MeHg or tHg concentrations and methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]] or mercury speciation. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/fish-containing-baby-foods]], [[ingredients/fish]], and [[ingredients/seafood]] as unresolved ingredient targets until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

See the page-level crosswalk above and [[products/regulatory-crosswalk-field-findings]] for current regulatory context; row-specific enforcement events remain pending.

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

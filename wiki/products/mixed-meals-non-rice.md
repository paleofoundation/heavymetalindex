# Mixed Meals, Non-Rice

This page is a structural scaffold for HMTc Category 1 row 12. FDA compliance samples now provide a direct non-rice mixed-meal lower-bound distribution, while broader savoury infant-food evidence remains useful context.

## Methodology

This page reports what the cited sources say about heavy-metal concentrations in non-rice mixed meals for infants and young children. The summary tables and inventories below are governed by a fixed set of methodology rules so the evidence is interpretable and auditable.

**Speciation is treated as non-substitutable.** Inorganic arsenic (iAs) and total arsenic (tAs) are reported separately; the toxicology and regulatory ceilings differ. Total chromium (Cr) is not interpreted as hexavalent chromium (Cr-VI) unless the source explicitly speciates Cr-VI.

**Basis is preserved and labeled, never silently converted.** Concentrations may be reported as wet weight (ready-to-eat), dry weight, or as sold. Each table below labels the source basis explicitly.

**Non-detect handling.** Where a source reports a value below its LOD or LOQ, this page preserves the source's reported handling convention.

**Source pooling is avoided.** Aggregate statistics are not computed by pooling across sources with different LOQs, sampling periods, geographies, and analytical bases.

**Row-fit.** Sources are classified by how cleanly their reported scope matches this product row. Direct row-fit means the author's stated scope matches this matrix. Partial or unknown fit means the author uses a broader category.

**Evidence tiers.** A-tier: peer-reviewed primary studies and government reports. B-tier: NGO reports and trade publications. Synthesis leans on A-tier.

**Confidence rating.** Low: 1–2 sources. Medium: 3–10 sources. High: more than 10 sources.

**HMT&C threshold-setting is separate.** HMT&C certification thresholds for products in this row are developed under the certification program at heavymetaltested.com, not on this page.

## Federal / Regulatory Limits vs Field Findings

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

This is the fast comparison view for standards developers, regulators, retailers, brands, and legal teams. It shows the applicable federal or regulatory limit next to the current field-evidence state. It is not an HMTc pass/fail table; technical distributions remain in the evidence sections below.

| Metal | Federal / regulatory limit | Actual field finding | Decision read | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | [[regulations/fda2025-lead-processed-baby-foods]]: Federal FDA final action level: 10 ug/kg Pb. Scope: fruits; vegetables excluding single-ingredient root vegetables; mixtures including grain- and meat-based mixtures; yogurts; custards/puddings; single-ingredient meats for children under 2. Basis: as sold or ready-to-eat as applicable. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | Regulatory value loaded for mixtures; field-finding comparison blocked until mixed-meal rows are extracted. | [[regulations/fda2025-lead-processed-baby-foods]]; [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |
| [[metals/lead]] (Pb) | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]: EU European Commission maximum level: 20 ug/kg Pb. Scope: baby food and processed cereal-based food for infants and young children, except covered infant drinks and formula/medical foods. Basis: product as placed on market. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | EU maximum level loaded; field-finding comparison blocked until mixed-meal rows are extracted. | [[regulations/eu2023-contaminants-maximum-levels]]; [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |
| [[metals/cadmium]] (Cd) | [[regulations/eu-2023-915-cadmium]]: EU European Commission maximum level: 40 ug/kg Cd. Scope: baby food and processed cereal-based food for infants and young children. Basis: product as placed on market. | Promoted field evidence exists, but comparable product-row values have not been extracted yet. | EU maximum level loaded; field-finding comparison blocked until mixed-meal rows are extracted. | [[regulations/eu-2023-915-cadmium]]; [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]] |

## Evidence Governance

Public evidence label: **Modeled or limited evidence**.

This page is part of the Category 1 Evidence Fitness pilot. It summarizes source-backed occurrence evidence, partial distributions, and data gaps for this product row. Existing cited tables remain public page-level synthesis; value-level tracking is maintained in the staff Standards Workbench.

This page does not publish or justify HMT&C certification limits. Public Index pages show what the cited sources say, what is still uncertain, and where readers can verify the evidence trail.

<!-- BEGIN: hmi-hmtc-evidence-summary -->
## Literature Evidence Summary

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

The table below summarizes what the peer-reviewed and government literature cited on this page reports for heavy-metal concentrations in non-rice grain-based mixed meal. Values are pulled directly from cited sources without re-aggregation. Aggregation, comparability review, and HMT&C certification threshold decisions are handled separately under the certification program; see the [methodology](/methodology) for the wiki/HMT&C separation.

Methodology rules for speciation, basis preservation, non-detect handling, and source pooling are stated in the [Methodology](#methodology) section above and apply to every row below.

| Analyte | Subcategory | Reported concentration range | Detection rate | Applicable regulatory cap | Sources | Confidence | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[metals/arsenic-inorganic\|iAs]] | non-rice grain-based (summary-only / supporting context) | highest reported 9 ppb | Sample-level detection rate not reported | No applicable cap loaded | 1 cited | low (1-2 sources) | as-consumed |
| [[metals/cadmium\|Cd]] | non-rice grain-based (summary-only / supporting context) | mean/median 2.2 to 10 ppb (3 sources); highest reported 44.4 ppb | 86% detected (66/77, Fda 2024, as-sold) | [[regulations/eu-2023-915-cadmium]]: 40 ppb (product as placed on market) | 3 cited | medium (3 sources) | as-sold; mixed-or-source-reported; as-consumed |
| [[metals/lead\|Pb]] | non-rice grain-based (summary-only / supporting context) | median 1.6 ppb (1 source); highest reported 13 ppb | 76% detected (59/78, Fda 2024, as-sold) | [[regulations/fda2025-lead-processed-baby-foods]]: 10 ppb (as sold or ready-to-eat as applicable) | 2 cited | low (1-2 sources) | as-sold; as-consumed |
<!-- END: hmi-hmtc-evidence-summary -->

## Lead Benchmark Context

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->
<!-- lead-benchmark-context:start -->

HMI normalizes this row's lead benchmarks to ppb so regulatory ceilings, exposure screens, and occurrence values can be compared on one concentration scale. The values below do not all mean the same thing: FDA and EU entries are regulatory context, Prop 65 is a serving-based exposure screen, and source tables on this page remain occurrence evidence.

| Reference point | Lead ppb view | Basis | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current [[regulations/fda-closer-to-zero|FDA Closer to Zero]] | 10 ppb (FDA final guidance action level) | ready-to-eat processed baby-food mixture | Mixtures including grain- and meat-based mixtures for babies and young children under 2 |
| [[regulations/eu-2023-915|EU 2023/915]] | 20 ppb | baby food as placed on market | EU maximum level. |
| [[regulations/california-prop65|Prop 65]] MADL screen | 4.5 ppb | 21 CFR 101.12 strained/junior ready-to-serve infant food RACC of 110 g; toddler dinner RACC is 170 g | Derived from the 0.5 ug/day lead MADL using `500 ÷ grams/day`; not a product-specific food limit. |
| HMTc standards use | ppb-normalized context | FDA is 10 ppb and EU is 20 ppb; the Prop 65 equivalent is about 4.5 ppb at 110 g/day or 2.9 ppb at 170 g/day. | Use FDA 10 ppb as regulatory cap/context and keep rice status separate so non-rice occurrence is not silently pooled with rice-containing meals. |

Mixed meals often have ingredient-driven variance; the ppb table helps distinguish legal compliance from actual category position.

## Scaffold Status

- Page state: evidence-backed scaffold with broad mixed-meal evidence; row-specific synthesis remains incomplete.
- Source coverage: measured-values table populated from promoted sources; row-fit caveats remain in the table.
- Next ingest target: mixed-meal datasets for non-rice products, especially [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].
- Ingredient targets are unresolved app-taxonomy placeholders, not source-backed typical-ingredient findings.

## Distribution Context

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The current source set does not yet support a non-rice mixed-meal HMTc the lower-end of the literature distribution. UK category-average data are structured as EF-4 context and broad Gardener 2019 all-sample percentiles can support screening context, but rice status and mixed-meal formulation must be resolved before threshold-setting use.

## Source Evidence Inventory

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Non-rice mixed meal evidence is currently broad. The closest values come from UK savoury infant foods without meat and meat/fish based dishes.

## French TDS Category Rows

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Chekri 2019 reports French vegetable-based and meat/fish-based ready-to-eat infant meals. The table does not split rice-containing from non-rice meals, so these rows are useful mixed-meal context but not a row-specific p90 distribution. [[sources/chekri2019-french-infant-toddler-tds-trace-elements|Chekri 2019]]

| French TDS row | N | Basis | Al mean / max | tAs mean / max | Cd mean / max | Cr-total mean / max | Ni mean / max | Sn mean / max |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Vegetable-based ready-to-eat meals | 27 | as consumed | 575 / 2480 ppb | 3.33 / 17 ppb | 9.26 / 18 ppb | 50.4 / 92 ppb | 71.5 / 137 ppb | 59.5 / 143 ppb |
| Meat/fish-based ready-to-eat meals | 45 | as consumed | 597 / 2590 ppb | 27.5 / 411 ppb | 9.31 / 30 ppb | 68.9 / 155 ppb | 75.7 / 143 ppb | 49.3 / 83 ppb |

## Row Relationship

This row is the clean-benchmark counterpart to [[products/mixed-meals-rice-containing]] for the row architecture relationship covering [[metals/arsenic-inorganic|iAs]], [[metals/cadmium|Cd]], and [[metals/lead|Pb]].

## Why This Category Is High-Risk

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, consumer, app -->

Risk characterization for this row is pending source ingest that can separate non-rice mixed meals from rice-containing mixed meals. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal datasets that distinguish non-rice products and report measured concentrations for iAs, Cd, and Pb. -->

A 2025 global scoping review reported that mixed foods excluding meat, fish, and rice had a median Cd concentration of 0.008 mg/kg among detected items, with 19% of detected items exceeding the Cd maximum level used by the authors. [[sources/collado-lopez2025-heavy-metals-baby-food-formula]]

## What Drives Variance Across Brands

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

Potential variance drivers for non-rice mixed meals should be documented only after sources distinguish ingredient composition, grain inclusion, vegetable inclusion, sourcing geography, processing, and analytical method. <!-- UNCITED: Need mixed-meal baby-food sources that separate non-rice from rice-containing meals and report methods such as [[testing/icp-ms]]. -->

## How The App Would Estimate Risk From An Ingredient List

<!-- audience: app, consumer -->

The app model placeholder for this row should treat [[ingredients/mixed-meals]] and non-rice ingredient targets as unresolved until source-backed contamination profiles exist. <!-- UNCITED: Need source-backed ingredient mapping and concentration distributions before app risk inference is populated. -->

## Levers to reduce contamination

Non-rice mixed meals (meat and vegetable combinations, pasta or oat-based blends) have a diverse contamination profile depending on ingredient composition. Lead and cadmium are the primary concerns in vegetable components; methylmercury is a concern in fish-containing mixed meals.

| # | Category | Specific lever | Magnitude | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sourcing | Source root vegetable components from low-Pb/Cd soil regions; source any fish components from low-trophic species with documented low MeHg burden. | _Quantified magnitude data not yet ingested from cited sources for non-rice mixed meal matrix; ingredient-level data applies upstream._ | — |
| 2 | Agronomic | Soil management at vegetable growing site reduces Pb and Cd in root and leafy vegetable components; upstream supplier lever. | _Quantified magnitude data not yet ingested; section will be expanded when intervention studies are available._ | — |
| 3 | Processing | Washing, peeling, and blanching of vegetable components reduces surface-deposited Pb; cooking meat components to discard drippings reduces some fat-soluble contaminants. | _Quantified magnitude data not yet ingested from cited sources._ | — |
| 4 | Formulation | Balance ingredient proportions to avoid over-reliance on high-Pb/Cd components; review full analyte panel for each ingredient category in the recipe before finalization. | _Quantified magnitude data not yet ingested for mixed-meal formulation trade-offs._ | — |
| 5 | Testing and QC | Lot-level ICP-MS on incoming ingredients (vegetables, grains, meat/fish) plus finished product testing for full HMT&C analyte panel. | _Quantified magnitude data not yet ingested for detection-power modeling._ | — |
| 6 | Packaging and storage | Not a primary lever for jarred or pouched mixed meals under normal conditions. | — | — |

## How standards math uses this page

This page documents what the cited sources report. The row-standard percentile in the Heavy Metal Tested and Certified (HMT&C) staff workbench is derived from the aggregate across all contributing sources after basis adjustment and row-fit review — it is not a decoration on any individual source row, and it is not published on this public page.

Citing this page at a single source's maximum value as if it were a threshold justification misreads the evidence architecture: the maximum observed in one study is not the same as a representative value across the full source pool. HMT&C certification threshold decisions are made separately under the certification program and are not published on this public page.

## Historical Recalls/Enforcement

<!-- audience: regulator, educator -->

See the page-level crosswalk above and [[products/regulatory-crosswalk-field-findings]] for current regulatory context; row-specific enforcement events remain pending.

No row-specific regulatory event has been added for this scaffold. <!-- UNCITED: Need agency records or enforcement notices before adding historical recalls or enforcement events; frame any future entries as regulatory events, not brand rankings. -->

## Broad Product Context: Author-Scope Index

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

The sources below are catalogued as product-context candidates for this row. The "Author-scope row-fit" column states what the authors actually resolved on each axis: matrix (cow milk-based, soy-based, rice-based, non-rice, or unresolved) and format (powder, ready-to-feed liquid, concentrated liquid, dry, or unresolved). A source counts toward this row's evidence pool only once; rows marked "Cross-reference" already appear as direct evidence elsewhere on this page and are not counted again here.

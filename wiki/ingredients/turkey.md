# Turkey

This is a structural ingredient node created so product pages can link to a real wiki target. Occurrence values remain pending until a source is promoted for this ingredient.

## Heavy metal contamination profile

Per-analyte snapshot derived from the machine-readable `contamination_profile` in the frontmatter above. `data gap` indicates the literature has been reviewed for this commodity-analyte combination and no usable occurrence data was found (a finding, not a placeholder). The Key sources column is populated by the per-metal body sections below where they exist; an automated Phase 3 enrichment will lift attributions into this table.

| Analyte | Coverage | Typical (ppb) | p95 (ppb) | Confidence | Key sources |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Pb | n=1 (in progress) | — | — | — | — |
| Cd | n=1 (in progress) | — | — | — | — |
| iAs | data gap | — | — | — | — |
| tAs | n=1 (in progress) | — | — | — | — |
| tHg | n=1 (in progress) | — | — | — | — |

## Routing

This node is linked from [[products/meat-and-poultry-purees]].

## Contamination Profile State

The machine-readable contamination profile is `pending`. Ingredient-level values belong here once parsed; finished-product values belong on the relevant product-category page.

## FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 Evidence

FDA's FY2018-FY2020 Total Diet Study dataset includes this page's routed matrix as TDS Food 26, "Turkey breast, oven-roasted." The normalized row-level data is stored in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_element_results_samples.csv`, with per-food/per-analyte summaries in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_summary_by_food_analyte.csv`. Concentrations are retained as FDA reported them, with reporting limits preserved separately; reported zeroes are not rewritten as `<LOD` without a source-specific rule.

## FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 Occurrence Values

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

FDA Total Diet Study FY2018-FY2020 reports prepared/composite-food concentration distributions for this ingredient as TDS food "Turkey breast, oven-roasted" ([[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]). Values are in ppb-equivalent on the basis FDA reported. The full sample-level data are stored in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_element_results_samples.csv`; per-analyte distributions in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_summary_by_food_analyte.csv`. These distributions count as one source under [[methodology/persistent-wiki-ingest-rule]] synthesis discipline; numerical values stay in body scratch until a second independent source is integrated.

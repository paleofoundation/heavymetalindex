# Fish fingers

FSA/Fera measured this ingredient or non-infant-specific food composite in Table 6 of the FS102048 survey. Exact concentration values remain in progress until Table 6 is parsed into structured ingredient rows with less-than and semi-quantitative flags preserved. [[sources/fera2014-fsa-metals-infant-foods-formula]]

## Routing

This node is linked from the ingredient index and source routing list.

## Contamination Profile State

The machine-readable contamination profile is `in_progress`. Ingredient-level values belong here once parsed; finished-product values belong on the relevant product-category page.

## FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 Evidence

FDA's FY2018-FY2020 Total Diet Study dataset includes this page's routed matrix as TDS Food 34, "Fish sticks or patty, frozen, oven-cooked." The normalized row-level data is stored in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_element_results_samples.csv`, with per-food/per-analyte summaries in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_summary_by_food_analyte.csv`. Concentrations are retained as FDA reported them, with reporting limits preserved separately; reported zeroes are not rewritten as `<LOD` without a source-specific rule.

# Cantaloupe

This ingredient stub was created during the FDA FY2018-FY2020 Total Diet Study element-results ingest so future source ingests have a stable destination for this food matrix. FDA reports this item as TDS Food 89, "Cantaloupe, raw/frozen." [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]

## FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 Evidence

The normalized row-level data for this TDS food is stored in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_element_results_samples.csv`, with per-food/per-analyte summaries in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_summary_by_food_analyte.csv`. Concentrations are retained as FDA reported them, with the reporting-limit column preserved separately; reported zeroes are not rewritten as `<LOD` unless a source explicitly says to do so. [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]

## Routing

This node is linked from the ingredient index and the FDA TDS source routing table.

## Contamination Profile State

The machine-readable contamination profile is `in_progress` for analytes measured in the TDS file and `pending` for profile metals not measured by this source. Ingredient-level values belong here once cross-source synthesis is reviewed; product-category values belong on the relevant product page.

## FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 Occurrence Values

<!-- audience: regulator, educator, app -->

FDA Total Diet Study FY2018-FY2020 reports prepared/composite-food concentration distributions for this ingredient as TDS food "Cantaloupe, raw/frozen" ([[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]). Values are in ppb-equivalent on the basis FDA reported. The full sample-level data are stored in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_element_results_samples.csv`; per-analyte distributions in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_summary_by_food_analyte.csv`. These distributions count as one source under [[methodology/persistent-wiki-ingest-rule]] synthesis discipline; numerical values stay in body scratch until a second independent source is integrated.

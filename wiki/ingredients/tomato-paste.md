# Tomato Paste

This page is an autonomy-created stub. The routing audit identified 2 source pages in the corpus declaring `ingredients: [tomato-paste]` in their frontmatter without a dedicated page existing. Per OPERATING.md Part 3, the autonomy loop created this stub so those sources route to a defined target. The synthesis pass per CLAUDE.md Part 9 fills in the contamination profile as sources accumulate.

## Heavy metal contamination profile

Per-analyte snapshot derived from the machine-readable `contamination_profile` in the frontmatter above. `data gap` indicates the literature has been reviewed for this commodity-analyte combination and no usable occurrence data was found (a finding, not a placeholder). The Key sources column shows the top 2-3 contributing sources by year and sample size, with numbered wikilink aliases.

| Analyte | Coverage | Typical (ppb) | Confidence | Key sources |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Pb | n=2 | 5–15 | low | [[sources/grochowska-niedworok2020-cadmium-lead-tomatoes-poland\|1]], [[sources/david2008-heavy-metals-canned-tomato-paste-romania\|2]] |
| Cd | n=2 | 30–70 | low | [[sources/grochowska-niedworok2020-cadmium-lead-tomatoes-poland\|1]], [[sources/david2008-heavy-metals-canned-tomato-paste-romania\|2]] |

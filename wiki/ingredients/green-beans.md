# Green beans

This ingredient stub was created during the FDA FY2018-FY2020 Total Diet Study element-results ingest so future source ingests have a stable destination for this food matrix. FDA reports this item as TDS Food 121, "Green beans, fresh/frozen, boiled." [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]

## FDA TDS FY2018-FY2020 Evidence

The normalized row-level data for this TDS food is stored in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_element_results_samples.csv`, with per-food/per-analyte summaries in `data/evidence/fda_tds_fy2018_2020_summary_by_food_analyte.csv`. Concentrations are retained as FDA reported them, with the reporting-limit column preserved separately; reported zeroes are not rewritten as `<LOD` unless a source explicitly says to do so. [[sources/fda2022-tds-elements-fy2018-fy2020]]

## Routing

This node is linked from the ingredient index and the FDA TDS source routing table.

## Contamination Profile State

The machine-readable contamination profile is `in_progress` for analytes measured in the TDS file and `pending` for profile metals not measured by this source. Ingredient-level values belong here once cross-source synthesis is reviewed; product-category values belong on the relevant product page.

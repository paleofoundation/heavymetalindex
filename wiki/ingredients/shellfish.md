# Shellfish

Shellfish is the regulatory umbrella covering crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, crayfish) and molluscs (mussels, clams, oysters, scallops, octopus, squid). The category groups together aquatic invertebrates whose feeding ecology — filter-feeding for bivalves, scavenging and detritivory for crustaceans — produces a distinctive contamination signal: high cadmium concentrations from sediment-water concentration gradients, total arsenic in the high-ppb-to-low-ppm range driven primarily by non-toxic arsenobetaine but with variable inorganic arsenic fractions, and occasional Pb spikes in waters with industrial or marine-paint legacies.

The cadmium-shellfish relationship is the strongest single-metal signal in the dietary-exposure literature: EFSA, JECFA, and the FDA all treat bivalve molluscs as a leading dietary Cd source for shellfish-consuming populations, comparable to organ meats and cereals. The total-vs-inorganic arsenic distinction (per CLAUDE.md Part 14) is non-negotiable for shellfish; tAs values appear alarmingly high but most of that signal is arsenobetaine, which is excreted intact and lacks the toxicity of iAs.

This page is the structural umbrella; [[ingredients/bivalve-molluscs]] carries bivalve-specific evidence and is the higher-risk subcategory for Cd. Crustacean-specific detail will land on dedicated pages as the corpus grows.

## Routing

Direct evidence for shellfish-as-category lands here. Bivalve-specific evidence routes to [[ingredients/bivalve-molluscs]]; product-level routing flows through seafood-bearing baby food and prepared-meal product pages.

## Contamination Profile State

All ten contamination_profile sub-blocks are `pending`. Cd, tAs, and the iAs/tAs ratio are the priority synthesis targets given seven contributing source pages already in scope. Speciation discipline (per Part 14) is load-bearing: never substitute tAs for iAs in shellfish prose or values.

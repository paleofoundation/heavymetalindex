// Every wiki page opens its markdown body with an `# H1` that repeats the page
// title, and the chrome renders that same title twice more: once in HeroBand
// (`h1.hero-title`, the visible page title) and once in ArticleTitle
// (`p.article-title`, hidden by the proof layout but still in the DOM). The
// result was 2-3 `<h1>` elements per page carrying near-identical text, which
// splits the title signal for search engines and gives screen-reader users
// three competing page headings.
//
// This plugin removes the leading duplicate. It runs on the mdast, before
// TableOfContents and Description, so the TOC, the Snav, and the auto
// description all see the corrected document rather than being patched
// downstream. The previous mitigation was a `display: none` rule in custom.scss
// keyed to a hand-maintained list of slug prefixes: it hid the heading on the
// eleven listed sections, left every other section duplicated, and never fixed
// the DOM-level problem at all.
//
// Only the FIRST block of the document is considered, and only when it is an
// h1. A mid-document h1 is left alone — it is a real section heading, not a
// title echo. Pages whose markdown does not open with an h1 are untouched.
//
// When the page has no `title:` in frontmatter, the heading text is promoted to
// the title instead of being discarded. FrontMatter falls back to `file.stem`,
// which is why /testing and /log rendered "index" and "log" as their headline;
// those pages carry the real title only in the body h1.

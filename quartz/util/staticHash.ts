import { createHash } from "crypto"

// A cache-busting token that is fixed for the lifetime of a single build
// process. The global stylesheet is emitted as `index.<STATIC_ASSET_HASH>.css`
// (quartz/plugins/emitters/componentResources.ts) and every page links that
// exact filename (quartz/components/renderPage.tsx). Both read this one constant,
// so within a build they always agree, and every build produces a fresh token.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The stylesheet was emitted as an un-hashed `index.css`. A
// browser holding a previous deploy's index.css could render this deploy's new
// hmi-v3-* markup against rules that no longer match — the homepage briefly
// rendered unstyled on bare burgundy. A per-build filename makes that
// structurally impossible: new markup references a filename the browser has
// never cached, so it can never apply a stale sheet. The hashed asset is safe to
// cache immutably (see vercel.json).
//
// A module constant (not emit-order state) is deliberate: Quartz runs emitters
// concurrently (Promise.all in processors/emit.ts), so the emitter cannot be
// relied on to set a shared value before renderPage reads it. A constant
// evaluated once at module load has no such race.

// This file answers "which pages appear in the menu, in what order, under what
// label". It is hand-maintained on purpose. A pure top-N-by-source-count would
// put `arsenic-total` and `copper` in the Metals panel and bury mercury, because
// the corpus is deepest where the literature is deepest, not where a reader
// starts. Selection is an editorial judgment; counting is not.
//
// What the generator adds: live source counts, live hub totals, and a
// build-blocking check that every slug below resolves to a real page. Numbers
// never live in this file — if you find yourself typing one, it belongs in
// tools/build-nav-panels.mjs instead.
//
// The generated output is quartz/components/generated/navPanels.ts, which is
// what TopNav imports. Run `node tools/build-nav-panels.mjs` after editing here;
// prebuild does it automatically.

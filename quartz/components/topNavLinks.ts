// Secondary destinations in the global top-navigation bar (TopNav.tsx).
//
// The primary taxonomy no longer lives here: it is the five mega-menu panels,
// whose contents are curated in `navPanels.seed.ts` and resolved (with live
// counts and a build-blocking dangling-slug check) into
// `generated/navPanels.ts` by tools/build-nav-panels.mjs.
//
// What remains is `utilityLinks` → secondary destinations (About). "Ask the
// Index" is not in this list: it is rendered by TopNav.tsx as its own pill.
//
// Hrefs are root-relative SIMPLE slugs (no leading slash, no extension).
// TopNav.tsx resolves each one against the current page with
// `resolveRelative(slug, href)` so the bar works at every directory depth and
// under a non-root base path. Keep these as bare slugs; do NOT hard-code "/".
//
// To add / reorder taxonomy entries, edit this file only. TopNav.tsx maps over
// these arrays verbatim, so there is no second place to update.
